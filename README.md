# PotatoGenerator

Potato√Ød mesh generator. An initial shape is used (for example a sphere), and every vertex is then translated by a number of perturbations. Perturbations have a direction, a frequency, and an amplitude, all of which will impact the displacement on the mesh. High and low frequencies are combined to generate a realistic shape.
